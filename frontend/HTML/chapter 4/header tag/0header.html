<!-- Header in a Webpage -->

<!-- The header is the top content of a webpage . It usually contains:-->

. Website logo or brand name

. Navigation menu (links to other pages/sections)

. Search bar

. contact info 


<!-- question:- now question is which tag we have to use to create a header of a website?-->

. ans:- div tag we can use to create a header but it is generic tag that is non semantic tag so it does't specifi the perpose of content so it would not seo and screen reader friendly so instead of div tag we should use <header></header> tag

. <header></header> tag is a semantic  tag it specifi the meaning or purpose of content so obviosly it would be seo and screen reader friendly.
