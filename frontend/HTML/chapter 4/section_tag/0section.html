<!-- section content in a webpage -->

<!-- what is section content -->

. group related content is called section content

. Usually, section  has its own heading (<h2>, <h3>, etc.) to describe the topic.

. Sections are used inside <main> (and sometimes <article>) to break content into organized parts.

. for example we can have An "About Us" section, "Services" section,"Contact" section,"Features" section in a product page



<!-- now question is which tag we have to use to create a section  of a website  -->

. we can use div tag to create a diffrent diffrent section but it is generic tag that is non semantic tag so it does't specifi the perpose of content so it would not be a se friendly and screen reader friendly  so instead of div tag we should use <section></section> tag.


. <section></section> tag is a semantic  tag it specifi the meaning or purpose of content so obviosly it would be se friendly as well as screen reader friendly.
