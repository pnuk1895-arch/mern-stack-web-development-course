<!-- now question is which tag we have to use to create a main content  of a website  -->
.we can use <div></div> tag to create a main but it is generic tag that is non semantic tag so it  does't specifi the perpose of content so it would not be a se friendly and screen reader friendly so instead of div tag we should use <main></main> tag.

    
. <main></main> tag is a semantic  tag it specifi the meaning or purpose of the content so  obviuosly it would be se friendly as well as screen reader friendly.

. should appear only once per Page.
