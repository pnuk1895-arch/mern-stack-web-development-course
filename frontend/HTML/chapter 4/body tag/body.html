<!-- 1.Why we should put content inside <body>? -->

->The <body> contains everything that should be visible to users on the webpage.

->Search engines (SEs) like Google read the <body> to find the primary content of the page.If we create the content without putting into the  body tag, SEs may not find your wbsite content

<!-- 2.To create a contnent on the webpage we should use semantic tags or non semantic tag inside <body>? -->

After knowing the content exists, SEs also need to know what kind of  content it is.so for this we should use Semantic tags bcz it tell SEs and screen readers about the role and meaning of the content.

Examples:
<header> → top content of the webpage

<nav> → Navigation links.
<main> → The main unique content of the page.

<section> → A thematic grouping of content.
<article> → Independent piece of content (like a blog or news
                post).

<footer> → Bottom information of the page.

<!-- 3. SEO Benefits of Semantic Tags -->

developer friendly: Developers can easily understand the  structure of your page.


<!--  so conclustion is: -->

content it is.
