<!-- what is inline element -->
Takes up only as much width as its content needs (not the full aviable width of the parent)
that's why it  Does not make new line b/w the elements

we can't set width ,height ,padding and margin 

Examples of Inline Elements:

<a> → links

<span> → generic inline container

<strong>, <em>, <b>, <i> → text formatting

<img> → images

<label> → labels for form inputs

<input> → form fields
