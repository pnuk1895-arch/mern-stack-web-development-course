<!-- Installation and set up  -->
step-01-installing ide or code editor 
1.To write a html document we need a code editor like note pad or ide 
(integrated development environment) software like VS code, code blocks, 
IntelliJ IDEA etc  
2.In window we have default code editor called note pad but note pad has 
some limitation 
<!-- 1.no autocomplete suggestion that is predictive text 
 2.no colourful syntax highlighting 
 3.not showing error if we make mistake 
 4.we have to do everything manually  -->

<!-- IDE SELECTION  -->
1. so, we should use ide like vscode, code blocks etc bcz 
2. it has autocompleted suggestion that is predictive text  
3. provide colourful syntax highlighting like keywords in blue, variable in green, 
error in red 
 4. we can write, run, find debug and compiled the code in one place 

 <!-- installing Browser  -->
1. browser (google chrome, Firefox, micrsoftedge) helps in converting html 
document in to the webpage so that user can interact with it

PRACTICE QUESTION 

 <!-- make a simple webpage and give title "first web page" and content "hey I have created my first webpage" by doing everything manually. --> 
Sol: - 
<!DOCTYPE html> 
<html> 
<head> 
<meta charset="UTF-8"> 
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-                   
scale=1.0"> 
<title>first web page</title> 
</head> 
<body> 
<p>😀 hey I am created my first web page</p> 
<body/> 
</html> 

<!-- what is html boiler code  -->
Ans html boiler plate code is a basic must tag that has to be write in order to write a 
html document 
<!DOCTYPE html> 
<html> 
<head> 
<meta charset="UTF-8"> 
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-                   
scale=1.0"> 
<title>boiler code</title> 
</head> 
<body> 
<body/> 
</html> 
<!DOCTYPE html>, <html>, <meta>, <head>, and <body> are boilerplate code, you 
write them in every HTML page, even though the main content changes. 

Explanation of each tag in boiler code: 
1. <!DOCTYPE html> → Tells the browser this is an HTML5 document. 
2. <html lang="en"> → Root element, language is English. 
3. <head> → Contains meta information (not shown on page). 
 3.1 <meta charset="UTF-8"> → UTF-8 allows us to use all languages + 
emojis directly. 
 3.2 If we used ASCII only, non-English text or emojis wouldn’t display 
properly. 
 3.3 <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial
scale=1.0"> → Makes site responsive on mobile. 
3.4 <title> → Title shown on browser tab. 
4. <body> → Actual content of the page (what users see). 
<!-- How to Generate boiler code in VS Code  -->
1. Type: exclamation mark(!) it gives emmit abbreviation  
2. Click on emmit abbreviation → VS Code will auto-generate the full HTML 
boilerplate.  

 <!-- make a simple webpage by using boiler code and give title "first web page"
and content "hey I have created my first webpage” -->
Ques-04 what is comment 
Ans A comment is a piece of text in code that is ignored by the browser or 
compiler. 
It’s written only for developers to explain the code, make notes, or temporarily 
disable some part of code 
Ques5- create a webpage showing” I am learning with techno globe” and use 
comments and some caseinsentive tags 

<!-- What the charset meta tag does -->
In HTML, the <meta charset="..."> tag tells the browser how to interpret
the,bytes of the page — that is, which character encoding to use.

<!-- for character encoding we gernally use utf-8 -->
example:<meta charset="UTF-8">
This means the page is encoded in UTF-8, which supports nearly all langauge
alphabet ,symbols and emojis in the world

<!-- for character encoding we can also use US-ASCII  -->
but it support only (A–Z, a–z, numbers, and punctuation).
Any special characters (like é, ₹, or emojis 😊) will break or show incorrectly.

<!-- what is the meaning of encoding -->
our computer doesn’t store text — it stores bytes.
Encoding tells how to translate those bytes back into readable characters

the viewport meta tag makes your webpage responsive
by telling the browser how to scale and display it on different screen sizes.
