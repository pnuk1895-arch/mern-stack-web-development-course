Step 1 — Open the Sources Tab:crl+shift+I or inspect and go to the source tab

The Sources panel is divided into three main sections (columns):

🟦 1. File Navigator (Left panel)

This shows all files loaded by the webpage.
You’ll also see your website’s domain at the top — for example:▶
https://example.com

When you expand it, you’ll find folders like:

/index.html
/script.js
/style.css
/images/

->You can click any file name here to open it in the middle panel.

🟨 2. Code Editor (Middle panel)

This is where the code content of the selected file appears.

You can read and set breakpoints here.

To set a breakpoint, click the line number (a blue marker appears).

When you reload the page, if that code runs, Chrome will pause there.

The current line (where execution is paused) will be highlighted in yellow.

🟩 3. Debugger / Information Panel (Right panel)

This section shows debugging information when code is paused.

It’s divided into smaller sub-panels:

Watch:Add variables to monitor (click + and type variable name).
Call Stack:Shows which functions were called to reach this line.
Scope:Shows local, global, and closure variables with their values.
Breakpoints: Lists all active breakpoints. You can disable
