<!-- Key points about View Page Source:  -->

->When you right-click on a webpage and select "View Page Source"It shows the
original HTML file that the server sent to your browser.

->It shows the static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript exactly as written by the
developer (before JavaScript runs and changes anything).

<!-- What you don’t see directly: -->

Changes made by JavaScript after the page loads. (For that, you need "Inspect"
"Elements" in DevTools).

Backend code (like PHP, Python, Node.js, etc.) since that runs on the server,
not in your browser.

In short:
View Page Source = The raw code sent from the server.
