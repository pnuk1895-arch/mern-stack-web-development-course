<!-- what you can do with Inspect Tools: -->

->Inspect allows developers to make live editing & testing until the design
looks good. Then the developer copies those edits to the actual source code.

->but those changes accur only in copies of orginal code

Example:
If JavaScript changes

<p id="msg">Hello</p>
to
<p id="msg">Welcome!</p>

View Page Source still shows Hello (original).
Inspect shows Welcome! (updated live).

->Check website responsiveness (see how the website looks on phone/tablet)

->include console for java script

->hightlights selected element on page

->See network activity (what files the page is loading, like images, CSS, data).
->

In short: Inspect lets you play with the website’s design and code in real-time.
