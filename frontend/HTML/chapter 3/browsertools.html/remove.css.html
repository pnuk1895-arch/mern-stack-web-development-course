<!-- When you open Inspect (DevTools), you can temporarily remove or change CSS to see how the page looks without styling. -->

<!-- Here’s how you can remove CSS: -->
 Method 1: Disable a single CSS rule

Right-click on the element → Inspect.

In the right side Styles panel, you’ll see the CSS rules applied.

Uncheck the box next to each rule (like color: red;, font-size: 20px;).

The style will be removed instantly.



Method 2: Remove entire stylesheet

In Inspect, go to the Sources or Network → CSS tab.

Find the .css file linked (like style.css).

Right-click on it → Disable / Block request URL (in Chrome).

This removes the whole CSS file.
