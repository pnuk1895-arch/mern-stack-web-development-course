// what is object?

//An object is a non primitive data type storing method as well as  collection of  data in  key value format.

example:

student={
    name:"sohan",
    age:24,
    city:'delhi',
    marks:{
    maths:55,
    english:56,
    hindi:78
    }
}


//fetaures of object

//-object is mutable that means it can be modify

//-Objects occupied a space in a heap and varaible pointing to occupied in a stack





//-now question how object data type organised in a heap memory ? 

//-Object are organized in heap memory using hash data table(internally array)

//example
let person = {
name: "Shahid",
age: 21,
isStudent: true,
obj: {

},
findage: function age() {

},

};

// hash("name") → 12 → "Shahid"
// hash("age") → 23 → 22
// hash("city") → 7 → "Delhi"
//hash("obj")->8 ->refrence of an nested object
