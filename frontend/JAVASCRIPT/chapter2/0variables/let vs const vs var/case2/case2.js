//second diffrence 
//we are declare the variable first with "let" and "var", then later if we want to change their value so we could not rewrite the value on the same place instead we reassign below the old variable.But in case of "const" we couldn't change their value also using reassignment because "const" means constant that is work as parmanent written variable.
 
//example using var

//  var a=12
//  a=20
//  console.log(a)

//example using const

//  const a=12
//  a=30
//  console.log(a)

//example using let

// let a=15
// a=40
// console.log(a)
