<!-- what is pseudo class -->
 A pseudo-class is used to change the states of the  HTML element based on the user’s action

<!-- syntax: -->

selector:pseudo-class {
    property: value;
}

here pseudo-class can be active,hover,focus and visited(in case of input element) etc.


<!-- For example: -->

When user hovers over a  button	
button:hover { background: blue; }

When user clicks a button	
button:active	{ background: red; }

When an input box is focused (clicked to type)
input:focus { border-color: green; }

<!-- homw work -->
When a link is visited	
a:visited { color: purple; }
