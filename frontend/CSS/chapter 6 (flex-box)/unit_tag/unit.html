<!--there are two types of length unit used to descibe the length of the element in css-->
 

1)absolute length unit:absolute length unit like pixel(px) is fixed length unit,if we expressed the css  length property in pixel  then will always take that size irrespective of the screen size.

but size of each phisical pixel will very from device to device 
this is bcz big screen has less dense and small screen has more dence so obviosly size of each phyiscal pixel will be small as compared to the large screen


2)relative length unit:Relative length units specify a length relative to another length property.

 

<!-- example -->
1)em-unit unit is used to set a font size Relative to the font-size of the parent element.
exm:1em,2em etc.

note:em unit also used for width but it will be relative to the font size of itself.

2)rem-Relative to font-size of the root element	

3)vw-Relative to 1% of the width of the viewport

4)vh-Relative to 1% of the height of the viewport
