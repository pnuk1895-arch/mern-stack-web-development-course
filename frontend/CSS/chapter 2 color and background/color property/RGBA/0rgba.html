<!-- Instead of specifying colors using predefined color names, 
     we can use RGB values. -->

<!-- This is because, in computers, every color is created by mixing 
     different intensities of Red, Green, and Blue. -->

<!-- The RGB color model defines colors using the intensity of 
     Red, Green, and Blue on a scale from 0 to 255. -->

<!-- RGB can produce over 16 million colors, whereas CSS color names 
     are limited to around 140 predefined names.-->
<!-- rgba -->

<!-- RGBA is an extension of RGB with an additional Alpha (opacity) channel, ranging from 0 (transparent) to 1 (opaque). -->
